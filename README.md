# render.js

This is a concept repository to (hopefully/eventually) re-implement the raytracer I have started for CS410 (written in Java), porting it to JavaScript (node.js)

# Ideas

* Write native bindings to [libigl](http://libigl.github.io/libigl/)/[Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/) to expose to JS
  * make this a native node.js module 

That's all I've got for now!
